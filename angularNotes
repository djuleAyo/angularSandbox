⭐️WHAT IS ANGULAR
Framework for spas - checkout pros and cons of spa apps and what is a framework.

VERSIONS
Angular1 - angular js and is diffrent from others
Angular 2+ are all updates of the same framework and refered to as just angular.

CLI
Comes with built in cli for project management
Commands:
ng new project_name
ng g c|s|m|f|d
ng s

COMPILATION
angular html is not valid html and must be compiled
angular source has many files
after compilation everything gets bundled - html, s?css, ts

POINT
Link static html with dynamic data of js process

TYPESCRIPT
ts-node to exe ts directly
do use types

FILES
angular.json - conf cli project (has global styles as well)
index.html is the file that is served - This file is bundled with needed scripts
main.ts - first code that gets executed. bootstraps a module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️COMPONENTS

HOW TO CREATE:
ng g c 
or manualy
import @Component from @angular/core
Must have template - inline or external
selector is opitional but if exists must be unique. Can be tag, class or attr 
styleUrls
and add to module declarations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️MODULES

decorator:
NgModule form @angual/core
imports - enlist other modules to import
bootstrap - component that gets bootstraped
declarations - declare all the things you need or they will be skipped in 
compilation
providers - provide services

bootstrap - which components is bootstraped - compiled by default
Default compilation compiles only needed things

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️DATA BINDING
String interpolation {{}} - used in template

Property binding [] - used in template + can bind to html default properties or
    to custom properties of your own

event binding () - used in template - event names do NOT have on prefix
    $event - special var that holds the value of the event - can be passed to 
    method handling the event

two way data binding [(ngModel)] - in template
    must import FormsModule to the module that uses 2 way data binding from 
    @angular/forms

NOTES: angular expression - access dynamic data from html - does NOT  need {{}}
for fool list of bindable prop and events see docs or console.log the element you
are torturing

-------------------------

To make custom events use @Output decorator from core on a property and bind 
to it in dom
Make those properties of type EventEmmiter from @angular/core (it is a generic)

To make custom property to bind to use @Inuput from @angular/core decorator 
and bind to it
NOTE: By default all properties of a component are accessable only from the component
NOTE: input and output support aliases. If neede see docs.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️DIRECTIVES 
instructions in the dom
- 2 types: built in and custom
- 2 types: attribute and structural

BUILT IN:
ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch - use with star... see explaination- these do NOT hide but remove from the dom
- these are structural directives and used with * prefix.
*ngFor="let x of array; let i = index" index is special val and is index of of loop

how to else in ngIf?
- one way: negate the expression
- or:
place local refrence to a ng-template directive and add 'else' dom to it
then in ngIf add else as follows: *ngIf="myFlag; else local_ref"

* prefix:
is syntatical sugar. It is desugared by angular to ng-template

ATTRIBUTE DIRECTIVES
NOTE: binding to property of directive is not same as directive it self
ngStyle - bind to it as [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: getColor()}"
ngClass - bind to it as [ngClass]="{myClass: expression}"

STRUCTURAL DIRECTIVES
Only one may be present

-------------------- Return here after later lectures

CUSTOM DIRECTIVE
does NOT change the dom (adds remove the elem) but changes the element it self
@Directive({
    selector:

})
Can inject the elem that has directive into the directive:
constructor(
    private elem: ElementRef
) {}
This is NOT the smartest way of accessing the element. No good to access the dom
directly

Use Renderer2 instead
Inject both elRef and Renderer2 and use renderer methods to access the dom
i.e. setStyle(elRef, 'background-color', 'blue') and opitonal 4th arg for important
Looks pretty the same as before... Why is it better?
Angular may run not only in a browser. There may be no dom at all. 
RULE: Any dom manipulation through Renderer2

@HostListener - listen to events  on directive
i.e. @HostListener('mouseenter') mouseover(enterData: Event) {}

@HostBinding - bind to props of directive
i.e. @HostBinding('style.backgroundColor') backgroundColor;

Also you can use @Input and @Output on directives
To bind to directive props just bind inside tag as follows
i.e. <p myDirective [myDirectiveProperty]="lalala"...
ng will figure out it is a prop of the directive
ngClass is bind like this: [ngClass]
How do you bind to prop of directive with same name as directive?
ez! Just name the prop so or use alias
Can bind to a prop w/o [] but right expr is taken as string and you may get confused
if it is custom prop or not

CUSTOM STRUCTURAL
<div *ngId="expr"        same as
<ng-template [ngIf]="expr">
    <div... 
Fuck this too much info for nothing. When you need custom structural directive 
dig the docs. Not too much but 2 more angular types: TemplateRef, ViewChild

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️DEBBUGING
Webpack serves src files(ts) in chrome and can debug directly the source
Checkout augury - chrome extension for angular

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️VIEW ENCAPSULATION

css is applied only to a component - not to the whole app
This is achieved by using attributes - ng compiles both css and htlm you provide
There are other methods - like shadow dom but this is not universaly supported
You can change encapsulation on each component in its decorator 
(and disable it as well)
None | Emulated | Native
Native is for shadow dom
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️LOCAL REFRENCES & @ViewChild 

i.e. When you 2 way bind input but you have save button and are interested for 
the value only when the button is clicked 2 way bind is overkill and you need
a way to access value of the element. Good place for a local ref

LR can be placed on any html element and is a refrence to whole html element 
not just the value. You can use LR ONLY in template, not in typescript!

@ViewChild from @angular/core
decorator take string - selector as an arg - not css selector but i.e. local ref
or a component
Resulting property is of type ElementRef from @angular/core
ElementRef has nativeElement wich is the element object it self
WARRNING: avoid accesing and changing the dom through elements accessed through
ViewChild

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️ng-content

by default any dom placed between components opening and closing tag is ignored
To enter dom into a component use nt-content directive in components template
and then dom entered between components tags will be entered instead of that
ng-content
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️Lifecicle hooks
OnInit interface from @angular/core

executed in this order:

constructor
ngOnChanges - when @Input get changes
ngOnInit - after constructor
ngDoCheck - run alot to check if there are any changes that trigger rerender
    do not run beefy code here
ngAfterContentInit - after initing dom given in ng-content
ngAfterContentChecked - similar as doCheck but for dom given in ng-content
ngAfterViewInit - after component init
ngAfterViewChecked
ngOnDestroy

WARRNING: ngOnChanges will not trigger if object ref is not changed even if the
object properties changed

@ContentChild from 
placing local ref on dom in ng-content is not @ViewChild. Its you guessed it:
@ContentChild and is used in same purpose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️PIPES

Unix - filter is a program that takes input, transforms it and outputs transformed
data. Those are usualy used as pipes in bash scripts. Usecase is similar in ng
Preserve original data, but display transformed data. Pipes are used in html
i.e. {{name | uppercase}}
parametrized pipes take args after ':'
i.e. {{date | date:'fullDate'}}
to see all args and all pipes see official docs 

pipes, as in unix can be chained

BUILTIN
uppercase, date

CUSTOM
pipe must have a certain method to be a pipe. Not a must but is recomended to 
implement PipeTransform interface from @angular/core
i.e.
transform(value: any) {
    return value.substr(0, 5);
}
Also needs a pipe decorator
name: pipeName
To parametrize custom pipe add more args to transform method. Voila!

PURE VS IMPURE FILTERS
By default filter is not rerun every time data changes
This is the reason why no built in filter pipes exist
To force updates add 2nd pror to decorator
pure: true|false

ASYNC PIPES
Works with promises and observables. For observable it subscribes automaticaly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⭐️SERVICES
regular class - should contain common logic
hierarchy incejction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⭐️ROUTING

Possible to change url without the page change - (browser api?)

Router - object that configures routing. The framework takes the config and voila!
appRoutes: Routes /*- router dcl */ = [
    {path: 'url', component: AComponent}
]

imports: [ // set conf obj as active for routing
    RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)
]

<router-outlet> the directive which will hold the component of the current route

routerLink="/url" - directive used to link stuff w/o reload or
routerLink=["/", "url"]
NOTE: If routerLink value is w/o / prefix it is relative
If the component links

routerLinkActive="className" - use on same element that has routerLink directive
decides to put the class if the route CONTAINS the path, NOT equals
To force equality must configure so i.e.

<an_element
routerLink='something something' 
routerLinkActive='something' 
[routerLinkOpitons]="{exact: true}"
>


NAVIGATE PROGRAMATICALY
inject private router: Router and use navigate method
Navigate method does NOT know the current route, but may be informed
i.e. inject route: ActivatedRoute and pass it to relativeTo conf field

this.router.navigate(['/url'], conf?: {relativeTo: this.route}) 
⚠️ relativeTo defaults to root so no / prefix and no relativeTo conf is relative
but to root = absolute 


PASSING PARAMS

{path: 'user/:id', component: lalala}
get the value of the param:
1) inject route: ActivatedRoute
2) this.route.snapshot.params['propName']

Note: snapshot does NOT change if the route changes. You could link from a component
with a route that displays the same component i.e.
form user/3 to user/5. Snapshot won't change and params on it won't either
To watch live changes get observable with 
this.route.params

PASSING QUERY PARAMS & FRAMGMENTS
i.e. localhost:4200/users/10?mode=editing&anotherone=value#afragment
bind to property of routerLink directive: [queryParams]="{}"
bind to property of routerLink directive: [fragment]="'loading'" or fragment='loading'
Only one fragment allowed

How to add these programaticaly?
this.router.navigate([...], {queryParams: {}, fragment: 'loading'})
When navigating params get lost. To perserve params use queryParamsHandling prop
of the conf object with values 'merge' | 'perserve'

How to read?
Through snapshot: queryParams prop & fragment prop
Through route: this.route.queryParams.subscribe() | this.route.fragment.subscribe()

⚠️ url is string. So are the numbers in it. Do cast (prefix + operator)

NESTED/CHILD ROUTES
{ path: 'users', component Lalala, children: [
    {...another rote conf}, 
    {...another rote conf}
]}
do add another router-outlet

REDIRECTING:
alternative prop in conf obje of the route to component prop is redirectTo
and the value of it is path
Paths may be wildcards.
Routes cascade - put wildcards on the end

OUTSOURCING THE ROUTE CONF:
make another module. See how in modules and export RouterModule from your routing
module

GUARDS
❓ is navigate method subjected to guards
Protect a route with method
Since it will be called multiple times good idea is to implement it in a service
which implements CanActivate interface wich defines canActivate method
canActivate(route: ActivatedRoute, state: RouterSnapshot):
promise<boolean> | observable<boolean> | boolean
To use defined guard and canActivate prop to route in Router conf obj
It is of type Array<GuardClass> where GuardClass implements CanActivate
Feel free to redirect(navigate) elsewhere in the guard service

To avoid adding canActivate to every child of a route use canActivateChild
and implement CanActivateChild interface in the guard service

canDeactivate

OBSERVABLES & HTTP & HTTP CLIENT

Angular subscriptions get unsubed but to get a good practice always unsub all
subscribes in ngOnDestroy

FORMS   ❗️
💥Template driven approach
no action on form to let angular handle the form
include FormsModule
add ngModel to an input you want to be a part of resulting object. w/o 2 way 
binding i.e [()] and provite name attribute to the input
to get data bind to ngSubmit on form element ⚠️ NOT on submit button
add local ref to the form element and pass that ref to ngSubmit handler
which gives the underlinig element
to access form data use #elementRefName="ngForm"
now passing elementRefName will give actual data in value property of the object

form states: dirty touched pristine disabled etc

another way to access data of the form is through ViewChild

VALIDATION
html native required, email
ng dynamically adds/removes classes
check list of built in validators in the docs
i.e. bind to disabled of submit button with valid field of the form elemRef

ACCESSING INDIVIDUAL FIELDS
place a local red on an input i.e. #ref="ngModel"

DEFAUL VALUES
bind to ngModel set on an input
2 way binding is still possible just like before

FORM GROUP
Place ngModelGroup on a container of group elements which must have a value
i.e. ngModelGroup="userData" and userData will be key name in resulting object
also can place ref on it and give value to the ref "ngModelGroup"

SETTING AND PATHCHING VALUES
access form element throug ViewChild and use setValue method which must take
whole object witch represents the form
or access form element through ViewChild and access form property of that object
it has pathValue method

RESETING
form elementref has reset method

💥Reactive approach
